# 🍽️ Predicting Restaurant Ratings Based on Reviews

This data science project focuses on predicting restaurant ratings using customer reviews. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are applied to analyze textual reviews and classify them into star-based ratings. The goal is to automate review analysis for restaurant platforms using machine learning.
